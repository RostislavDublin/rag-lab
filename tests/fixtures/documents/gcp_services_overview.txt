# Google Cloud Platform Services Overview

## Compute Services

### Cloud Run
Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform for running containerized applications. Key features:
- **Automatic Scaling**: Scale from zero to thousands of instances
- **Pay-per-use**: Only pay when requests are being handled
- **Container-based**: Deploy any language or framework
- **HTTPS endpoints**: Automatic SSL certificates
- **Cold start**: ~1-3 seconds for lightweight containers

Pricing: $0.00002400 per vCPU-second, $0.00000250 per GiB-second

### Cloud Functions
Event-driven serverless functions for lightweight workloads:
- Supports Node.js, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP
- Triggered by HTTP, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage events
- Maximum execution time: 60 minutes (2nd gen)
- Ideal for: webhooks, data processing, IoT backends

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Managed Kubernetes service for container orchestration:
- Standard mode: managed control plane
- Autopilot mode: fully managed nodes
- Integration with Cloud Monitoring and Logging
- Binary authorization for security

## Storage Services

### Cloud SQL
Fully managed relational databases:
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 supported
- **MySQL**: Version 5.7, 8.0 supported
- **SQL Server**: 2017, 2019, 2022 supported
- High availability with automatic failover
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- pgvector extension available for PostgreSQL

Typical pricing: $0.0150/hour for db-f1-micro (shared CPU, 0.6GB RAM)

### Cloud Storage (GCS)
Object storage for any amount of data:
- **Standard**: Hot data, frequently accessed
- **Nearline**: Accessed less than once per month
- **Coldline**: Accessed less than once per quarter
- **Archive**: Long-term storage, accessed less than once per year

Standard storage: $0.020 per GB/month in us-central1

### Cloud Firestore
NoSQL document database:
- Real-time synchronization
- Offline support
- ACID transactions
- Automatic multi-region replication

## AI/ML Services

### Vertex AI
Unified AI platform with:
- **AutoML**: Train custom models without code
- **Vertex AI Workbench**: Managed Jupyter notebooks
- **Model Garden**: Pre-trained models
- **Prediction endpoints**: Deploy models with auto-scaling
- **Vector Search**: Billion-scale similarity search

### Gemini API
Google's multimodal AI models:
- Gemini 1.5 Pro: 1M token context window
- Gemini 1.5 Flash: Fast and efficient
- Gemini 2.0 Flash: Latest model with native tool use
- Native multimodal: text, images, video, audio

Pricing (Gemini 1.5 Flash):
- Input: $0.075 per 1M tokens
- Output: $0.30 per 1M tokens

### Text Embedding Models
Convert text to vectors:
- text-embedding-005: 1408 dimensions, best quality
- text-embedding-004: 768 dimensions, legacy
- multimodalembedding: images + text

Pricing: $0.025 per 1M tokens

## Networking

### Cloud Load Balancing
Global load balancing with:
- HTTP(S) Load Balancing
- TCP/SSL Proxy Load Balancing
- Network Load Balancing
- Anycast IP addresses

### Cloud CDN
Content delivery network:
- Cache static content at edge locations
- Integrated with Cloud Storage and Cloud Run
- Cache-to-cache filling
- Pricing: $0.08-0.20 per GB depending on region

## Security

### Cloud IAM
Identity and Access Management:
- Fine-grained access control
- Service accounts for applications
- Workload Identity for GKE
- Policy inheritance

### Secret Manager
Store API keys, passwords, certificates:
- Automatic rotation
- Versioning
- Audit logging
- Integration with Cloud Run, Cloud Functions

## Monitoring & Operations

### Cloud Monitoring
Full-stack monitoring:
- Infrastructure metrics
- Application metrics
- Custom metrics
- Uptime checks
- Alerting policies

### Cloud Logging
Centralized logging:
- Real-time log management
- Log-based metrics
- Log exports to BigQuery
- 30-day default retention

## Best Practices for Cost Optimization

1. **Use Cloud Run for stateless services** - pay only for actual usage
2. **Choose appropriate storage classes** - move old data to Nearline/Coldline
3. **Enable committed use discounts** - save up to 57% for predictable workloads
4. **Use preemptible instances** - save up to 80% for fault-tolerant workloads
5. **Monitor with budgets and alerts** - avoid unexpected costs
6. **Use same region for all resources** - avoid egress charges
7. **Delete unused resources** - clean up test environments regularly

## Regional Considerations

### US Regions
- us-central1 (Iowa): Lowest price, good connectivity
- us-east1 (South Carolina): Close to East Coast
- us-west1 (Oregon): West Coast, renewable energy

### Europe Regions
- europe-west1 (Belgium): Lowest latency for Europe
- europe-west4 (Netherlands): Carbon-neutral

### Asia Regions
- asia-northeast1 (Tokyo): Lowest latency for Japan
- asia-southeast1 (Singapore): Southeast Asia hub

Network egress within same region: $0 (free)
Network egress between regions: $0.01-0.08 per GB
