Advanced Information Retrieval Techniques

Introduction

Combined retrieval methods integrate multiple search strategies to improve accuracy and relevance in retrieval-augmented generation frameworks. This document explains the practical implementation of these techniques.

Core Methodology

The combined search approach operates in three stages:

1. Dual Retrieval Phase
   - Semantic matching via vector embeddings (dense representation)
   - Lexical matching via BM25 or similar (sparse representation)
   - Both methods execute concurrently

2. Score Normalization and Fusion
   - Normalize relevance scores from both retrieval pathways
   - Merge using weighted average or RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
   - Default configuration: 0.7 semantic weight + 0.3 lexical weight

3. LLM-Based Reordering (Optional)
   - Language model relevance evaluation
   - Cross-encoder architectures for pairwise assessment
   - Final sorting by reranking scores

Advantages

- Enhanced recall: lexical matching captures precise term matches overlooked by embeddings
- Improved precision: semantic understanding interprets user intent beyond literal words
- Fault tolerance: framework remains functional if either pathway fails

Deployment Requirements

The methodology necessitates:
- Vector datastore for embedding persistence and approximate nearest neighbor queries
- Inverted index structure for term-based retrieval
- Score harmonization to balance both pathways

Benchmark results demonstrate that combined retrieval approaches typically deliver 15-20% superior accuracy versus single-strategy methods in production retrieval-augmented generation environments.
