        <h2>Exhibition Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Visions of Tomorrow</strong> showcases groundbreaking works from 12 pioneering 
            digital artists exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, human creativity, 
            and emotional expression. This immersive exhibition features interactive installations, 
            generative art, and AI-assisted sculptures that challenge our perception of authorship 
            and creativity in the digital age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors will experience art that responds to their presence, evolves over time, and 
            questions the boundaries between human and machine creativity. The exhibition includes 
            virtual reality experiences, algorithmic paintings, and neural network-generated sculptures.

            <p>
                Turkish-American media artist Refik Anadol presents a mesmerizing 8K data sculpture 
                created using machine learning algorithms trained on millions of architectural photographs. 
                The installation transforms collective memory into dynamic visual narratives, creating 
                fluid dream-like landscapes that challenge our understanding of space and memory.

            <p>
                Chinese-Canadian artist Sougwen Chung collaborates with custom robotic arms trained

                spontaneous compositions where AI responds in real-time to human gestures, exploring 
                co-creation between biological and artificial intelligence.

            <h3>Mario Klingemann - "Memories of Passersby I"</h3>
            <p>
                German artist Mario Klingemann uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create 
                an endless stream of unique portraits that never repeat. The artwork consists of two 
                wooden consoles housing neural networks that generate male and female faces in real-time, 
                each portrait existing for mere seconds before being replaced by a new creation.

                <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Custom GAN-based installation</li>
