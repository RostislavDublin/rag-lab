SECURITY TEST FILE

This file is used exclusively for testing protected metadata fields security.

The test verifies that users CANNOT override system-protected fields like:
- uploaded_by (user identity from JWT)
- uploaded_at (timestamp)
- uploaded_via (source: api, cli, etc)
- original_filename (real filename)

Any attempt to provide these fields in metadata should result in HTTP 400 error.

This prevents security attacks:
- User impersonation (fake uploaded_by)
- Timestamp manipulation (fake uploaded_at)
- Audit trail bypass (fake uploaded_via)

This file should ONLY be used in test_03c2_security_protected_metadata_fields.
